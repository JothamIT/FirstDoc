# FirstDoc
## Checking out Github.  

I only had the account but never utilized it for my **projects**.
so *this morning* I logged in and went through the instructions and boom, here I am writting my first output.
```{r}
read(book_reviews)
```
- I guess I can copy paste an external RMD.
- How about a a doc from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com)
